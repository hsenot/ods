Open Data Social
================

A set of tools & projects around open data in Australia.

Goal
----

To help fulfill a vision for open data - transparency for people-powered, democracy-strengthening, public good projects.


Approach
--------

Improving the experience of working with open data by:

- Lowering the bar for access (time and skills) to focus more energy on the societal problems to solve rather than the technicalities
- Broadening the problem-solver profiles around data, not just the CS/IT usual suspects


Rationale
---------

For open data to reach its full value, it needs a "social governance" layer to address multiple pain points faced by the open data community:

- **data everywhere**: many organisations have become publishers, leading to an overload of overlapping data sources and data portals. Discoverability and disambiguation are key issues in this data overload.
- **adequacy evaluation**: getting familiar with a dataset to evaluate its adequacy for a use case is expensive as it involves reviewing (grouped) record counts, value ranges, categories, distribution of values, ... 
- **data quality**: it's often difficult to understand the overall dataset quality (e.g. completeness, recency, outliers, ...) and limitations (e.g. collection method, processing / lineage)
- **linkability**: datasets are often published as single table / entity but often joining up datasets is where the magic happens, if the datasets can be joined (persistent IDs, spatial references, resolved entities)
- **usefulness**: most data catalogues present a flat list of datasets but they're far from equal in "usefulness". Surfacing the "highly useable" datasets (popular, good quality, recent, linkable, ...) from the niche ones is a key issue.
